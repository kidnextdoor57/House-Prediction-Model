# 🏡 House Price Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the prices of houses based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, size, and other key attributes.  
Using **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, the goal is to build a predictive model that helps estimate house prices with reasonable accuracy.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Explore and preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, encoding, feature scaling).
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationships between features and prices.
- Build and evaluate different regression models.
- Compare model performances to select the best-performing algorithm.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data collection & cleaning  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering & preprocessing  
4. Model training (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Model evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)  
6. Final model selection  

## ✅ Results
The project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real estate pricing.  
By leveraging regression techniques, the model provides valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices and achieves reliable predictive performance.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Experiment with advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).  
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.  
- Integrate more diverse datasets to improve generalization.
